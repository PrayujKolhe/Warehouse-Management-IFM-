# Warehouse-Management-IFM
# Smart Warehouse Monitoring System

A compact prototype warehouse system using **IFM sensors** and a **PLC** to improve operational safety and environmental monitoring.

## 🔧 Overview

This system integrates:
- **Inclination Sensor (IFM JN2100)**: Detects tilt in forklifts or shelves to prevent tipping accidents.
- **Temperature Sensor (IFM TA2115)**: Monitors ambient temperature to ensure optimal storage conditions.

## ⚙️ Features

- Real-time tilt detection with alerts for unsafe angles.
- Temperature monitoring with alerts on exceeding set limits.
- PLC-based control logic for high reliability and industrial compatibility.

## 🧰 Components

- **PLC**
- **IFM J2N100** – Inclination Sensor  
- **IFM TA2115** – Temperature Sensor  
- **Buzzer** or **Indicator** for alerts  

## ✅ Output Achieved

- Successfully detected unsafe tilt angles and triggered warning signals.
- Real-time monitoring of warehouse temperature with threshold-based alerts.
- Demonstrated improved safety and awareness in a simulated warehouse environment.
