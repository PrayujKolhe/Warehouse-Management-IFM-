# HMI Description

The Human-Machine Interface (HMI) in this warehouse prototype is designed for real-time monitoring of critical parameters using interactive visuals and sensor feedback.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Live Sensor Graphs**  
  - **Inclination Sensor (JN2100):** Real-time graph displaying tilt angle variations.  
  - **Temperature Sensor (TA2115):** Real-time temperature trend graph for monitoring environmental changes.

- **Current Values Display**  
  - Digital display of current tilt angle and temperature readings alongside the graphs.

- **Visual Alerts**  
  - Color indicators (e.g., red for unsafe tilt or temperature).
  - Active buzzer alert status shown when conditions exceed limits.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  - Clean layout for quick understanding.  
  - Helps operators track system behavior instantly and take timely action.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Enables precise and real-time monitoring of warehouse conditions.  
- Helps prevent forklift tipping and temperature-sensitive product damage.  
- Supports safer and more efficient warehouse management.
